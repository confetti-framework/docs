# Logging

## Introduction

To help you learn more about what's happening within your application, Confetti provides robust logging services that allow you to log messages to files, the system error log, and even to Slack to notify your entire team.

Under the hood, Confetti utilizes the [Syslog](https://github.com/confetti-framework/syslog) library, which provides
support for
a variety of powerful log handlers. Confetti makes it a cinch to configure these handlers, allowing you to mix and match them to customize your application's log handling.

## Configuration

All of the configuration for your application's logging system is housed in the `config/logging.go` configuration
file. This file allows you to configure your application's log channels, so be sure to review each of the available
channels and their options. We'll review a few common options below.

By default, Confetti will use the `stack` channel when logging messages. The `stack` channel is used to aggregate
multiple log channels into a single channel. For more information on building stacks, check out
the [documentation below](#building-log-stacks).

### Configuring The Channel Name

The name provided is for reference only, so you can log specifically to that channel.

``` go
"daily": loggers.Syslog{
    Path:           Path.Storage + "/logs/{yyyy-mm-dd}_default.log",
    MinLevel:       syslog.DEBUG,
    AppName:        App.Name,
    MaxFiles:       14,
    HideStackTrace: true,
},
```

### Preconceived Channels

Name | Description
------------- | -------------
`stack` | A wrapper to facilitate creating "multi-channel" channels
`single` | A single file or path based logger channel
`daily` | A new log file every day, old ones are automatically deleted
`slack` | A channel that pushes messages to Slack
`stderr` | Logs are written to stderr

> It is very easy to create a channel yourself. Use an existing logger or create your own. The loggers only need to implement interface `inter.Logger`.

### Configuring Most Common Loggers

Most channels are based on `loggers.Syslog`. This logger can write files, but can also be used by any Ê»io.Writer`.

Name | Description | Default
------------- | ------------- | -------------
`Path` | The path to the log file |
`Permission` | The log file's permissions | `0644`
`MinLevel` | The minimum "level" a message must be in order to be logged | EMERG
`MaxFiles` | Automatically clean up old logs when overwriting x number of logs | 0 (off)
`HideStackTrace` | If true, no stack trace will be logged | false
`Facility` | Specify the type of program that is logging the message | 8 (USER)
`Writer` | Define your own writer here |

### Configuring The Slack Channel

The `slack` channel requires a `WebhookUrl` configuration option. This URL should match a URL for
an [incoming webhook](https://slack.com/apps/A0F7XDUAZ-incoming-webhooks) that you have configured for your Slack team.
By default, Slack will only receive logs at the `critical` level and above; however, you can adjust this in
your `logging` configuration file.

### Building Log Stacks

As previously mentioned, the `stack` driver allows you to combine multiple channels into a single log channel. To
illustrate how to use log stacks, let's take a look at an example configuration that you might see in a production
application:

``` go
Channels: map[string]inter.Logger{
    "stack": loggers.Stack{
        Channels: []string{"daily", "slack"},
    },

    "daily": loggers.Syslog{
        Path:     Path.Storage + "/logs/{yyyy-mm-dd}_default.log",
        MinLevel: syslog.DEBUG,
        MaxFiles: 14,
    },

    "slack": loggers.Slack{
        WebhookUrl: env.StringOr("LOG_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL", ""),
        MinLevel:   syslog.CRIT,
    },
},
```

Let's dissect this configuration. First, notice our `stack` channel aggregates two other channels via its `Channels`
option: `daily` and `slack`. So, when logging messages, both of these channels will have the opportunity to log the
message.

### Log Levels

Take note of the `MinLevel` configuration option present on the `daily` and `slack` channel configurations in the
example above. This option determines the minimum "level" a message must be in order to be logged by the channel.
loggers.Syslog, which powers Confetti's logging services, offers all of the log levels defined in
the [RFC 5424 specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424): **emergency**, **alert**, **critical**, **error**, **warning**, **notice**, **info**, and **debug**.

So, imagine we log a message using the `debug` method:

``` go
app.Log().Debug("An informational message.")
```

Given our configuration, the `daily` channel will write the message to the system log; however, since the error message
is not `critical` or above, it will not be sent to Slack. However, if we log an `emergency` message, it will be sent to
both the system log and Slack since the `emergency` level is above our minimum level threshold for both channels:

``` go
app.Log().Emergency("The system is down!")
```

### Creating Custom Channels And Loggers

As indicated earlier: it is very easy to create channels and loggers yourself. A channel is a combination between a
name (present as a key in config.Logging.Channels) and a logger. A logger is simply a struct that conforms to
interface `inter.Logger()`.

Let's create a NewRelic channel:
``` go
"new_relic": new_relic.LogFacade{
    AppName: App.Name,
    Labels:  App.Env,
    License: env.Str("NEW_RELIC_LICENSE"),
},
```

The logger `new_relic.LogFacade{}` only needs to support interface `inter.Logger{}`.

## Writing Log Messages

You may write information to the logs using the `Log` facade. As previously mentioned, the logger provides the eight
logging levels defined in the [RFC 5424 specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424): **emergency**, **alert**
, **critical**, **error**, **warning**, **notice**, **info** and **debug**:

``` go
app.Log().Emergency(message)
app.Log().Alert(message)
app.Log().Critical(message)
app.Log().Error(message)
app.Log().Warning(message)
app.Log().Notice(message)
app.Log().Info(message)
app.Log().Debug(message)
app.Log().Log(syslog.ALERT, message)
```

So, you may call any of these methods to log a message for the corresponding level. By default, the message will be
written to the default log channel as configured by your `config/logging.go` configuration file:

``` go{10}
package controller

import (
    "github.com/confetti-framework/contract/inter"
    "github.com/confetti-framework/routing/outcome"
)

func ShowProfile(request inter.Request) inter.Response {
    name := request.Parameter("name")
    request.App().Log().Info("Showing user profile for user: %v", name.String())
    //
}
```

### Contextual Information

If you have data that you want to include in the logs, you can use the other parameters. Use `%v` as a placeholder:

``` go
app.Log().Info("User %v visit page %v.", "Vapor", "/features")

logData := map[string]int{"name": "Horizon"}
app.Log().Info("User failed to login. %v", logData)
```

More complex contextual data may also be passed to the log `...With()` methods. This contextual data will be
formatted to JSON and displayed with the log message:

``` go
logData := map[string]string{"id": id.String()}
app.Log().InfoWith("User failed to login.", logData)
```

If you want to log data as prescribed by the standards, use `syslog.StructuredData`:

``` go
logData := syslog.StructuredData{syslog.SDElement{"id": id.String()}
app.Log().InfoWith("User failed to login.", logData)
```

### Writing To Specific Channels

Sometimes you may wish to log a message to a channel other than your application's default channel. You may use the
first parameter from the `Log` method to log to any channel defined in your configuration file:

``` go
app.Log("slack").Alert("Something happened!")
```

If you would like to create an on-demand logging stack consisting of multiple channels, you can use multiple parameters:

``` go
app.Log("single", "slack").Info("Something happened!")
```

### Groups

If you have a large system, it might be smart to group logs together. This makes it easier to filter your logs. For
example, you could create a group named `external` to log request and responses, and a group named `worker` for
background jobs.

``` go
log := app.Log().Group("external")

log.Info("Task started")
log.Alert("Something happened!")
```

The above example (in combination with `loggers.Syslog`) results in the following:

```
<6>1 2020-11-01T21:42:51.439+01:00 MacBook-Pro.local YourApp 95375 external [level severity="info"] Task started
<1>1 2020-11-01T21:42:52.134+01:00 MacBook-Pro.local YourApp 95375 external [level severity="alert"] Something happened!
```
