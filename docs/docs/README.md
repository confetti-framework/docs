# Confetti documentation

## Meet Confetti

Confetti is a web framework written in Go (Golang). The web framework consists of the most important components to create your
 application. The goal of Confetti is to give you all the tools you need to write fast, secure and scalable code.

Whether you are new to Go or web frameworks or have years of experience, Confetti is a framework that can grow with
you. We can't wait to see what you build.

## Why Confetti?

Confetti was created by dissatisfaction with PHP and the appreciation of Laravel. In serious applications PHP lags behind in terms of performance, asynchronous and strict typing. Still, PHP has something that other languages don't have: Laravel.

Go shows that it is a language with very simple syntax, easy to learn and very easy to deploy. Confetti combines the
elegance of Laravel and the strictness of Go.
